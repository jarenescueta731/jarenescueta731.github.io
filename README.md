### Personal Portfolio

Contains my favorite projects I created with Free Code Camp using HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript/jQuery.

This repo represents many firsts for me:

  - my first hosted website (thanks GitHub)
  - my first *real* GitHub remote repository
  - my first experience with Git and Markdown (pretty useful)

### To-do

  - Add link(s)?
  - extra stuff?
