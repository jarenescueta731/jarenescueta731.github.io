### Personal Portfolio v2.0

In making this site, I focused on using mobile-first responsive design.
You can find a few projects I created with HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript/jQuery.
Once I make the tic-tac-toe and simon-says projects on Free Code Camp, I'll earn their Front End Development certificate.


This repo represents a couple firsts for me:

  - my first hosted website (thanks GitHub)
  - my first *real* GitHub remote repository


### To-do

  - What is gitignore's importance? Add it.
  - Overhaul TwitchTV app and Calculator w/ responsive design.
  - Pomodoro responsiveness could use work.
  - Replace Weather App & Star Wars Quotes w/ tic-tac-toe & simon-says.


### The near future and beyond...

I'm hoping to refactor these projects in the future with Sass and Bootstrap 4.
At the time of this update, I've enrolled in a number of courses on Udemy on the topics of advanced JS, React & Redux, along with a few courses in Node, Rails, and C# to get into some back end. In the future, I'll display the projects I've mode with those languages here.
